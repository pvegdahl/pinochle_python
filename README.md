# pinochle

This is a learning project to build a Pinochle game.  I'm trying to use a functional style (no data mutation) which I'll wrap using a shell that does all of the side effects.  I'm also trying to use rigorous TDD, at least for the functional business logic.

For now it is backend only.  Maybe someday I'll add a frontend.  For that matter, who knows to what extent I'll even finish the backend!  This is purely for fun, learning, and exploration.  When I'm done with all of those things, I may just drop it.

NOTE:  I never quite got all the way on this one, and I'm not planning to come back.
